Simple Tags
    --> Tags are nested according to their indentation. 
    We don't need to close tags, as soon as Pug encounters the next tag on same or outer indentation level, it closes the tags for us.

    --> To put text inside of a tag, there are 3 methods-
        -Space separated(For Example: h1 Welcome to Pug)
        -Piped Text(For example: div
                                |To insert Multiline text,
                                |Pipe operator can be used )

        - Block of text(For example:
                                    But that gets tedious if you have a lot of text.
                                    You can use "." at the end of tag to denote block of text.
                                    To put tags inside this block, simply enter tag in a new line and 
                                    indent it accordingly.)

//This is a pug Comments

Attributes-->To define attributes, we use a comma separated list of attributes,
                in parenthesis. Class and ID attributes have special representations. 
                The following line of code covers defining attributes, classes and id for a given html tag.
<div class = "container column main" id = "division" width = "100" height = "100"></div>
